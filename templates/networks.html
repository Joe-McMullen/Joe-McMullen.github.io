                This project aims to develop an Expected Threat(xT) model and use the xT of passes as weights in a team's passing network
                to gain insight into the influence of players to attacking phases of team's play. xT is a statistical model which estimates 
                the likelihood of scoring within the current posession based on location on the pitch. Using this, events which move the ball
                such as passes or dribbles can be given a value based on the increase in likelihood of scoring between the location where the 
                event started and finished.

                Passing networks (pictured below) can be used to gain insight into the connections and structure of a team when in possession.
                Traditionally a football passing network considers the players of a team as nodes located in the average position of their passes made.
                The connections(edges) between two players represent the volume of passes between them. This project extends the use of networks in football
                by considering the xT created by passes
                between players as the edges to determine which combinations are most important to advancing the ball into more dangerous positions.
                Using network measures, the pass networks produced can be analysed to assess team performance and player role within the team system.

                in terms of a markov model. The pitch is broken down into (16 x 12) tiles and in each tile, there is the possibility to shoot,
                pass, or dribble (pass and dribble will be grouped as "move" actions herein). To calculate an xT value for each tile, we need to know the probability
                that an action occurs at a tile and the reward for the action.

                To calculate the reward for moving in a given tile, we need to consider the probability of moving from any tile to any other. This is the transition 
                matrix for the model \( T \). We can then simulate a number of actions into the future to determine the probabilities of
                future scenarios. The reward for moving in a tile is the percentage of these simulations which orginate in the selected tile and move to another, ultimately ending in a goal. 
                Karun's original implementation only considers successful actions and to account for this, the number of iterations in the simulation he proposes is relatively low
                at 4 or 5.

                Finally, this gives a model which provides the likelihood that possession in a tile will culminate in a 
                goal. Below you can see the model results for the first half of the 2023/24 LaLiga season. As expected, areas close to the opposing
                goal have high threat values due to the high chance to shoot and score in directly in these tiles. However areas close to the opposing
                goal line also have relatively high threat values even though it is unlikely to shoot in these areas. This is due to the high likelihood
                of moving to those threatening central areas. In general, threat value of a tile increases exponentially as you approach the opposing team's
                goal.

                To produce pass networks for a team in a given game, we consider the longest time period during which a team did not make any substitions.
                We then need the passer and receiver for all passes that occured during the period to create a pass matrix as seen below where matrix entries tell us the volume

                Being able to construct pass networks and xT networks, we would like to analyse these networks to understand which players 
                are most important to the structure of a team in posession.
                Eigenvalue centrality(EC) is a network measure that gives the transitive importance of a node to the network. If considering
                a network of links such as the internet (pictured below), we can say a web page is important to the network if it is linked to by many other
                important pages. Google used this approach in their <a href="">PageRank</a> search engine algorithm.
                Web pages with more links from more important web pages are presented to users first.

               Whilst we can produce an xT model over all of the data as seen above to get an average estimate for the threat value of each tile,
               we can also produce xT models for individual teams to gain insight into how their attacking profiles may differ. In the figure below,
               we can see the differences between the top 4 teams in the league (as of 15/4/24). Real Madrid (top right) have a high expected threat
               focused centrally in the penalty area whilst Atletico Madrid have a wider and more shallow profile of high

                Understanding where a team creates threat from gives us an idea of the attacking patterns that are most effective for them, with 
                implications for coaches and analysts. For example, a coach may want to reinforce the effective patterns and getting the ball
                to the high threat zones, whilst an opposition analyst may highlight these higher threat zones as key areas to defend. However, to what extent
                these findings are reliable is hard to judge given that they are reliant on a relatively small sample of goal events and the dynamic nature
                of football means that a team's tactics are always prone to change. As a result, it may be prudent to also consider the insights gained from 
                pass networks weighted with xT.

                Comparison of the two shows the forward players tend to be more influential in their contribution to the attaking network
                than the count network, the fewer passes they are involved in create more threat. This is due to the areas in which they play having a steeper gradient
                on the xT profile. We can see that Barcelona are quite homogenous in the way they attack, with many players having an even share
                of xT involvement. We can also see that no. 15 (Christensen) is important to the pass network but less important to the xT network. 
                This suggests he circulates in build-up phases but is not important to attacking play. No. 9 (Lewandowski) is the opposite, being involved in few 
                passes but more threatening passages of play.

                Goalkeepers (green) had lower relative importance
                to the network and were more important to passing than receiving, indicating they are often originators
                of possession. Strikers (red) show the opposite trend with greater importance as receivers suggesting
                they act as sinks for passing moves. Defenders (blue) tended to be of high importance to both networks
                which suggests they are heavily involved in passing moves in intermediary stages. Midfielders (orange)
                can be seen to vary in profile with some showing a correlation similar to strikers whilst others are within
                the defenders cluster. This suggests more complexity within the midfield class, with some midfielders
                performing a different role in a team's passing than others. However, the average in and out pass
                eigenvector centrality are highly correlated, the intuition for this is that it is highly likely when a player
                receives a pass, they continue the possession and give another pass regardless of position.

                Next we considered the importance of players as passers and receivers to the xT networks, again taking the average across all games
                players participated in.
                These results shows weaker correlation between players contribution when considering positive xT contribution than when
                solely considering pass count. In addition the grouping of positions among the outfield roles is much
                sparser. Considering expected threat, greater distinction can be made between players suggesting more variety in the role players 
                take up in the attacking phase of play. Midfielders particularly show a wide spread with some being important for receiving high-xT
                passes and others important as attacking passers.

                To further investigate the difference in pass network and xT network importance, the importance as a passer or receiver in both networks was
                directly compared. An EC difference metric is proposed as the difference between xT network EC and pass network EC. A more positive value in this metric
                indicates more importance to in attacking phases. The importance of midfielders as receivers in the network can be seen below.

                As previously discussed, midfielder is a broad classification which describes a wider range of
                roles than other positions. The receiver importance plot shows examples at both extremes
                of EC difference with some midfielders important for receiving large numbers of non-threatening passes 
                whilst others are important for receiving aggressive attacking passes. The results indicate it is difficult 
                to be important for receiving many passes and receiving dangerous passes.

                The passer importance plot shows more correlation; those who are important for making many passes tend to be important for making dangerous passes.
                It is interesting to note the cluster of players important for receiving many safe passes (Toni Kroos, Frenkie De Jong, William Carvalho) are also
                important for making many dangerous passes. In this way, we can start to define player profile, this cluster has a profile which may be described as
                a deep-lying high-volume progessive passer just by considering the two scatter plots.

                As an extension to the application of network science in football, it can be seen that considering the
                positive xT contributions as edge weights gives insight beyond the pass count. xT allows for a more
                nuanced understanding of the importance of a player within their team and their role within the network
                particularly in attacking phases, and expands upon the discrete classification that position labels provide.
                This type of player profiling has potential applications in recruitment and tactical deployment in games.

                This project focused on the use of network measures for analysis of individual players, however, the nature
                of network science means that behaviour is captured within a complex system and the results can not be
                considered to be a global measure of an individual's performance or ability. To what extent the findings
                are due to the team around a player, or the task assigned to them by a coach, is unknown. They could
                give an indication a player is able to perform a similar role in a similar setup but not a guarantee. 
                In this way, network measures may be used to understand some of the complexity in football performance and applied as tools for
                player profiling and performance analysis.

                Future work could see further extensions to the principles applied here, with more networks and more network comparisons yielding
                more detail into team structure and player role. For example, using tracking data, we may begin to consider pressing networks where 
                we look at teams structure when pressing by considering the distance between teammates when out-of-possession as links in a dynamic network.
                We may also consider the proximity of players to their opponents as links to understand how efficiently space is controlled by the pressing team.
